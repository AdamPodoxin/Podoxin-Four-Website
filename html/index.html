		<p id="about"><i>Podoxin Four</i> is a music band that plays smooth funk jazz compositions. The band was formed in 2017 in Vancouver, BC, Canada by Stas Podoxin. The uniqueness of the band is that the players are all members of the Podoxin family. Another distinctive feature of the band is that all, but one, of our players are children, ages 15, 12, and 10. At of the time of this website's creation, Adam (15) is playing drums, Gabriel (12) on the saxophone, and Leo (10) on the keyboard. Their father, Stas, is the bass player and the band's leader. The band's style is influenced by artists such as Grover Washington, Maceo Parker, David Sanborn, Gerald Albright, Euge Groove, Spyro Gyra, Stevie Wonder, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Dave Grusin, George Benson, Al Jarreau, Lee Ritenour, Shakatak, Mezzoforte, and many others. So far, the band is mainly playing covers, but also has its own original compositions, such as <i>Let's Funk Up</i> written by Leo and Stas and <i>In the Smooth Mood</i> written by Stas. Recently, the band has recorded some of its pieces at a professional sound recording studio. The result is presented on this website. These recordings were done in one take, as evident by the minor mistakes we occasionally made (see the <a href="gallery.html" class="hyperlink"><i>Gallery</i></a> page). We hope you enjoy the music. If you would like the band to perform at your event, don't hesitate to contact us at the <a href="contact.html" class="hyperlink"><i>Contact</i></a> page.</p>
