      <p class="about">
        <i>Podoxin Four</i> is a music band that plays smooth funk-jazz
        compositions. The band was formed in 2017 in Vancouver, BC, Canada by
        Stan (Stas) Podoxin. The uniqueness of the band is that the players are
        all members of the Podoxin family. As of the time of this website's
        launch, Adam (15) is playing drums, Gabriel (12) on the saxophone, and
        Leo (10) on the keyboard. Their father, Stan, is the bass player and the
        band's leader.
      </p>
      <p class="about">
        The band's style is influenced by artists such as Grover Washington,
        Maceo Parker, David Sanborn, Gerald Albright, Euge Groove, Spyro Gyra,
        Stevie Wonder, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Dave Grusin, George Benson, Al
        Jarreau, Lee Ritenour, Shakatak, Mezzoforte, Rippingtons, Tower Of
        Power, Victor Wooten, and many others. So far, the band is mainly
        playing covers, but also has its own original compositions, such as
        <i>Let's Funk Up</i> written by Leo and Stan and
        <i>In the Smooth Mood</i> written by Stan. Recently, the band has
        recorded some of its pieces at a professional sound recording studio.
        The result is presented on this website on the
        <a href="html/music.html" class="hyperlink"><i>Music</i></a> page. We
        hope you enjoy the music. If you would like the band to perform at your
